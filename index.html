                Ghosts of Valor was founded in South Africa back in 2019 with the launch of Call of duty 2019 or Call of Duty Modern Warfare which was a soft reboot of the once successful game Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare.
                The team was formed when legendary COD player KD and Modern Warfare Specialist Tempest(later TempestFury) joined forces with the Infamous Wolfpack Brothers Keenster & Scooby.
                The original team went by the name of Cape Town Valor and achieved a notorius name around Verdanski after maintaining outstanding kill/death ratios and beating +1000 squads in the forgotten mode of Plunder.
                <br>
                <br>
                In later additions of the squad they opened up their ranks to the legendary marksman Josh and the Multiverse Fortnite traveller AB Kidd. With the team almost complete they were missing one final piece that came in the form of the Deadly PoisonIvy.
                Once the final piece was added they rebranded the taskforce to the unstoppable force we know them as today, Ghosts of Valor. They dominated maps such as shipment, achieved countless victories on shoothouse and won the Team of the Week 9 times in a row.
                They became champions of both Plunder and Battle Royal being the only squad to hold the legendary, hidden, secret and lost blueprints.
